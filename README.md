# NerdyKnitting
A place to put nerdy knitting tools

The goal for this repository is to hold a bunch of nerdy knitting tools. Two things that I want to do (or have started) are: 
   1. A tool that will take raw data and convert it into a knittable pattern
   2. A pop-up that will remind you what color to use for your temperature blanket
